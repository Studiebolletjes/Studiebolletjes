The only real solution is HTTPS. If you don't want to do SSL on your whole site 
(maybe you have performance concerns), you might be able to get away with only 
SSL protecting the sensitive areas. To do that, first make sure your login page
is HTTPS. When a user logs in, set a secure cookie (meaning the browser will 
only transmit it over an SSL link) in addition to the regular session cookie. 
Then, when a user visits one of your "sensitive" areas, redirect them to HTTPS, 
 and check for the presence of that secure cookie. A real user will have it, a 
 session hijacker will not.
